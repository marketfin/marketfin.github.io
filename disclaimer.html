                  securities. Neither the information presented nor any statement or expression of opinion, or any other matter
                  herein, directly or indirectly constitutes a solicitation of the purchase or sale of any securities. Neither the

                  underwriters. Investing in securities, including the securities of those companies profiled or discussed on this
                  website is for individuals tolerant of high risks. Viewers should always consult with a licensed securities
                  professional before purchasing or selling any securities of companies profiled or discussed on MarketFin.com. It
                  is possible that a viewer's entire investment may be lost or impaired due to the speculative nature of the
                  companies profiled. Remember, never invest in any security of a company profiled or discussed on this website
                  unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. Also, investing in micro-cap securities is highly
                  speculative and carries an extremely high degree of risk. MarketFin.com makes no recommendation that the
                  securities of the companies profiled or discussed on this website should be purchased, sold or held by viewers
                  that learn of the profiled companies through our website.
